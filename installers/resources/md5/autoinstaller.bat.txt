auto installer

	md5
	logging
	tracking
	upgrading

Description

Two primary installation types take place, those requiring administrative privlidges and those which "must" be installed "as" the end user.

Logging

Logging takes place on the server and is done by workstation and user_name_and_type
	
	So administrative users log goes to 
		server/base_logging_url/workstation_name/admin_log

	Users log goes to 

server/base_logging_url/workstation_name/user_log

	Combined log is generated on demand as

server/base_logging_url/workstation_name/combined_log


Programm installation logging

	server/base_logging_url/workstation_name/install_log
		installed_program_name
		installed_program_version

		


Programs have the following standard variables

program_name
program_version
installer_file
installer_url

Programs may have the following

target_installation_dir


Other items may include

logging_url
mdb_db_url
server_tracking_url

Program types
	This should be logged
		admin_install
		user_install

Server tracking URL

server_name
	base_dir_url
		workstation_url
			admin_url (?)
			user_url
				program_url

copy over any files
	on error -> log
verify_md5
	on error -> notify and log
execute installer
	check_for_prereqs
		on error -> notify and log
on_completion
