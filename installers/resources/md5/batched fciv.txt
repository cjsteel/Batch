How to use the FCIV utility to check the installation of a Citrix environment


The text below can be added to a batch file and run on a known good server. The 

batch file creates an XML file that contains the database of all the files in the directories and subdirectories listed.

fciv.exe -add "c:\program files\citrix" -r -XML c:\citrixfiles.xml
fciv.exe -add "c:\winnt\system32\ctxgina.dll" -r -XML c:\citrixfiles.xml
fciv.exe -add "c:\winnt\system32\ctxrdpwsx.dll" -r -XML c:\citrixfiles.xml
fciv.exe -add "c:\winnt\system32\vdtw30.dll" -r -XML c:\citrixfiles.xml
fciv.exe -add "c:\winnt\system32\wsxica.dll" -r -XML c:\citrixfiles.xml
fciv.exe -add "c:\winnt\system32\drivers\wdica.sys" -r -XML c:\citrixfiles.xml
Pause

Once the text above is added to a batch file and modifies the location of where to store the database, follow the procedure below to create the XML database file:


1. Run the batch file on a known good server. This creates a file called citrixfiles.xml on the C drive.

2. To list the contents of the database to the console, type the following command:

fciv.exe -list -XML c:\citrixfiles.xml

3. To verify the contents of the XML database against the server that is to be verified, type the following command:

fciv -v -XML c:\citrixfiles.xml ( this could also be piped to a text document)

Note: Files that do not match appear in the command window.

There are known files that do not match on the servers, such as IMAlhc.mdb, any logs that are in the folders such as Resource Manager logs, and Resource Manager summary files that are waiting to be uploaded.
